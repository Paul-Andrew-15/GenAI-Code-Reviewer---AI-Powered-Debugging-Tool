# GenAI-Code-Reviewer---AI-Powered-Debugging-Tool

## Overview
This project, developed during my internship at Innomatics Research Labs under the guidance of Kanav Bansal Sir, is an AI-powered code review and debugging tool. The application enables users to submit Python code for analysis, identifying bugs, inefficiencies, and areas for improvement.

The application leverages Google Gemini API to analyze submitted scripts and provide detailed feedback with corrected code snippets, helping developers, students, and programmers write better, error-free code.

## Features
**1. Intuitive User Interface (UI) - Built with Streamlit**
* A clean, interactive, and user-friendly design.
* Users can input Python code via a text area or upload script files.
* A "Debug" button for AI-powered analysis.
* Displays error reports, suggested fixes, and optimized code snippets.
  
**2. AI-Powered Code Review & Debugging**
* Integrates Google Gemini API for intelligent analysis.
* Detects syntax errors, logical bugs, and inefficiencies.
* Recommends best practices for cleaner, optimized code.
* Provides corrected and enhanced Python code snippets.
